# Portal-2627-Public-Releases
This is a portal beta mod that contains the campaign from 2006 and 2007, followed by bonus content such as the Still Alive maps and fixes for various beta and prototyping maps. This mod will also contain it's own Custom Campaign!

This repo is for the public relases that don't contain experimental or unfinished content.

To make this mod at least a little bit more enjoyable, all of the maps can be seletced in the bonus maps menu, all organized into folders!
