This repo is for the public relases that don't contain experimental or unfinished content.

To make this mod at least a little bit more enjoyable, all of the maps can be seletced in the bonus maps menu, all organized into folders!

Here's a list of maps you can explore:
* Custom Portal 2627 Campaign (There is only 1 Map for this campaign)
* 2006 Campaign
* 2007 Campaign
* Beta Still Alive Maps
* 2006 Beta/ Prototyping Maps (and some fixed and tweaked versions of these maps)
* 2007 Beta/ Prototyping Maps (and some fixed and tweaked versions of these maps)
* A Beta Model Museum Map that displays Unused and Early Models (Currently left in an early state of development)

To install the mod: unpack the zip folder and place the portal_2627 folder in your steam/steamapps/sourcemods Folder. 

Most relases of this mod will have a different foloder name than just portal_2627. The current release foldoer has the folder name portal_2627_alpha_1, so you should place that folder in your sourcemods folder. When the project is finallout out of Beta Phase of Deveopment, the folder name will just be portal_2627.
